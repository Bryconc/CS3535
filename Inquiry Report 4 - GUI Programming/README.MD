# Problem #
We want to be able to program GUIs to our applications in python.

# Questions #
1. What is Python's native GUI toolkit?
2. What third party python libraries can help build GUIs?

# Resources #
1. [Python GUI Programming (Tkinter)]
2. [Jython Documentation]

### Mini-abstract and relevance of [Python GUI Programming (Tkinter)] ###

Python's native GUI toolkit is Tkinter. Tkinter is object oriented so it feels very similar to programming GUIs with Java's Swing.

The standard formula for creating a Tkinter GUI is as follows:

> Import the Tkinter module.

> Create the GUI application main window.

> Add one or more of the Tkinter widgets to the GUI frame

> Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.

Tkinter has a variety of widgets that can be graphically rendered:

| Button | Renders a button in your application |
|:------:|--------------------------------------|
| Canvas | Draws shapes in your application     |
|        |                                      |
|        |                                      |
|        |                                      |
|        |                                      |
|        |                                      |
