Finally managed to make the commit. We're rocking and rolling now!

So for my modification I basically made an extension of the Cowbell from remix/examples/cowbell. I made modified the code to remove the Christopher Walken aspect. From there I replaced the cowbell sound effects with those of a hard base, extending the possibilities for number of files and soforth.
